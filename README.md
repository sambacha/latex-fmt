# latex-fmt

> LaTeX Linting and formatter

## Overview

This set of scripts was extracted from latexindent git repo, and fixed to be used outside of their original intended usecase (test validation scripts).


## Usage

Must have installed latexindent already.

Have the YML config files where you run the script. Run fmt and your LaTeX whitespace etc will be prettier'ed.
